## 📍 How to Access Admin Panel

### **Direct URL Access:**
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/login
```

## 🔑 Admin Authentication

### **Login Method:**
- **Email & Password** (NOT phone number like regular users)
- Uses Firebase Email/Password authentication
- Separate from user authentication system

### **Admin Credentials Setup:**
To set up admin access, you need to:

1. **Create Admin User in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
   - Click "Add User"
   - Enter admin email and password
   - This user will have admin privileges

2. **Backend Configuration:**
   - Ensure your backend recognizes this email as admin
   - The backend should return `role: 'admin'` for this user

### **Separation from User App:**

- ✅ Admin uses email/password, users use phone/OTP
- ✅ No admin role option in user role selection

### **Access Control:**
- Admin panel requires specific email/password credentials
- Backend should validate admin role before granting access
- Admin dashboard is protected by authentication

## 🛠 Development Notes

### **File Structure:**
```
src/pages/admin/
├── AdminLogin.js    # Email/password login
└── CLI.js          # Admin dashboard
```

### **Routes:**
- `/admin/login` - Admin login page
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin panel (protected)

### **Authentication Flow:**
1. Admin goes to `/admin/login`
2. Enters email/password
3. Firebase authenticates
4. Backend validates admin role
5. Redirects to `/admin/dashboard`

## 📱 User vs Admin Flow

### **Regular Users:**
```
Phone Number → OTP → Role Selection (Client/Freelancer) → Dashboard
```

### **Admin:**
```
Email/Password → Admin Dashboard
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Cannot Access Admin Panel:**
1. Check if admin user exists in Firebase
2. Verify email/password credentials
3. Ensure backend recognizes user as admin
4. Check browser console for errors

### **Admin Login Fails:**
1. Verify Firebase configuration
2. Check if user has admin role in backend
3. Ensure proper error handling in AdminLogin component

**Note:** The admin panel is intentionally separated from the main user application to maintain security and provide a dedicated management interface.
